						<p>It was a paradoxical moment to see drummer, Jesso Ron Montejo, performing with WilaBaliW in front of 30,000 people as former drummer Robert De La Cruz hovered behind him on stage, watching his every move.

						Many people think this was an intimidating moment, but to Jesso this was a moment of pride.

						As with most band member replacements, a lot of comparisons happen. Factions occur, haters troll, but for some reason WilaBaliW fans have never questioned this move when Robert left the band in 2013.

						It could be owed to the fact that Jesso is an overall nice guy to many of his peers. He  is an extremely funny guy and is admittedly a fan of many things with influences highlighting his openness to music, “Honestly, it’s quite a mix. My uncle used to play and collect albums of the Beatles… (He) Plays Celine Dion, Barbara Streisand, Billy Holiday, and the likes… You know… The standards.”</p>

						<p>Tattoo wars</p>
						<p>"Dutdutan"

							A celebration of art and ink.
							Dutdutan is currently the nation’s biggest and grandest annual tattoo exposition, presented by Tribal Gear Philippines. 

							A venue for the finest of skin arts, this is the one event where acclaimed tattoo artists, enthusiasts, supporters, and even curious first-timers gather to marvel, get inked, compete, and experience skin artistry at its best. Dutdutan is also the one place and time when age and social status cross boundaries to take pleasure in a very personal and intimate brand of self expression.

							Taking on a different level each year, Dutdutan brings in more and more tattoo artists from all over the country and the world. Participants from other countries have taken interest in this extraordinary event and would want to experience tattoo ‘pinoy’ style.

							Highlights of Dutdutan include competitions of creativity and innovation among the best tattoo artists in the local scene. Premier inkers battle for prestige in various categories, exhibiting ingenuity and artistic mastery in the field of skin art. ‘Tattoo of the Day’ remains the most coveted award as artists from this category create their entries on the day itself, giving everyone a chance to actually witness a master at work, and how art pieces are created on skin.</p>

						<p>Sa bahay lang</p>
						<p>The initial Beyond the Summit, Defense of the Ancients 2 (Dota 2) event took place in June, and it was a rousing success. The Evil Geniuses crew came away with the title, and thus have been selected as the invited team to compete against five other squads in Beyond the Summit 2.

						From December 3-7 from a "lowkey private home in the Greater Los Angeles area," per the event's official website, the second BTS battle will be waged. The structure of the event is somewhat similar to the HomeStory tournaments for StarCraft 2. However, when players aren't embroiled in a match, they will be an active part of the broadcast.</p>
